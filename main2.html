				<h2>Rules of the game</h2>
				<h3>General concepts</h3>

				<p class="pRules">
					In the game "Bulls & Cows" are two players(one of which is a computer)<br><br>

					At the beginning of the game, the first player makes a number from non-repeating numbers. 
					During the game, the second player tries to guess the number. 
					To do this, he calls another number from non-repeating numbers, 
					and the first player tells him the number of "bulls" and "cows"<br><br>

					The number of "bulls is the number of guessed figures standing at the right places<br>
					The number of "cows" is the number of guessed figures that are not in the right places<br><br>

					For example, let the first player make the number "3219", 
					and the second player offers the number "2310". 
					In this case, the result will be 1 bull (the number "1" is at the right place) 
					and 2 cows (the numbers "2" and "3" are on the wrong places)
